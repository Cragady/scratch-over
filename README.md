# Scratch-Over

Lang = Python

# Reason

A week or two ago (Date today is 2/22/19), I decided to learn a little bit of Python. I didn't know what would be a good project to work on, but eventually I thought up of an old Scratch project that the U of U Coding Boot Camp assigned before the course began. That project can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198253712/). Seemed like the perfect thing to port over to Python. 

So far, it seems like all of my code is spaghetti, but it works.

# To Do
* Change insano speed to lvl 4
* change insano shooting to lvl 3
* Add in animation for letting player know that they have automatic shooting
* Lvl 2: fly-cat, here it adds extra life
* Lvl 3: Drop-cat
* @ Lvl 4: fly-cat adds extra shooting too

# Later Things

## Player

* Meow sound on game over
* Glide to center on new game
