# Scratch-Over

Link to [Scratch Project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198253712/)

Lang = Python

# Reason

A week or two ago (Date today is 2/22/19), I decided to learn a little bit of Python. I didn't know what would be a good project to work on, but eventually I thought up of an old Scratch project that the U of U Coding Boot Camp assigned before the course began. That project can be found [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/198253712/). Seemed like the perfect thing to port over to Python. 

So far, it seems like all of my code is spaghetti, but it works.

# Things
* ~~Fix music timing, starts too early sometimes~~

# Later Things

## To Do 2

* Clean/Organize
* Meow sound on game over
* Fill in pause screen

# Known Bugs
* Sometimes fly_cat will crash the game, err given: cannot pop from empty list (interesting)
  * Make fly_cat invulnerable for half a second or one?
* Sometimes The game won't start on enter/space but will play the music. Just push esc, and this will unfreeze and put you into the game
* Occasional lag
* Music has weird timing while transitioning every now and then
* Certain button inputs pressed right before/after the Space/Enter, to initiate game start, will crash the game
